# RFC-043 - Permissions Pagination & Filtering

### Synopsis

This is an extension of previous RFC where we introduce pagination, sorting and filtering for the different
entities of the user service. In this specific case we will only focus only on the permissions entity.

### Background

Permissions pagination will be used for paginating the admin page like stated on [RFC-015](https://calmisland.atlassian.net/l/c/mG0HWucL). Here we will focus everything that is necessary for the new permissions query.

Currently exists a permission connection query, but is not used anywhere, so we should be fine with making the change.

### Implementation

To understand more about pagination go the original implementation proposal [document](https://calmisland.atlassian.net/l/c/tB1bg4Yo). Here you can find all the details about pagination and why is done the way it was done.
Specifically for permissions it will look like the following:

```graphql
    extend type Query {
       ...
       permissionsConnection(
            direction: ConnectionDirection!
            directionArgs: ConnectionsDirectionArgs
            filter: PermissionFilter
            sort: PermissionSortInput
        ): PermissionsConnectionResponse @isAdmin(entity: "permission")
       ...
    }
```

For the response the most important thing to define is the node, the rest will look exactly the same.

#### Node

Aside from the core information for the entity is important to understand entities can be related to other
entities but if more information is necessary the correspondent entity connection node should be used.

```graphql
type PermissionConnectionNode {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    category: String
    group: String
    level: String
    description: String
    allow: Boolean!
}
```

#### Filters

```graphql
input PermissionFilter {
    organizationId: UUIDFilter
    roleId: UUIDFilter
    name: StringFilter
    allow: BooleanFilter

    # joined columns
    AND: [PermissionFilter]
    OR: [PermissionFilter]
}
```

#### Sorting

```graphql
enum PermissionSortBy {
    id
    name
    category
    group
    level
}

input PermissionSortInput {
    field: PermissionSortBy!
    order: SortOrder!
}
```

#### Permissions

- Super admins (which are being defined at https://bitbucket.org/calmisland/kidsloop-user-service/src/4b530317d54c86214ce7bb913231f2f8b899a29d/src/permissions/userPermissions.ts#lines-16 - Connect to preview until we have a better way, e.g. introduce a new role/permission): all permissions that are matching with the filters in the database are returned
- Other users: only permissions that the user is able to see and match with the filters are returned

### Out of scope
- This is the first iteration of this query. On the future new attributes can be added, and even improvements on
the implementation. This RFC will not take that into consideration
- This RFC does not reference how to make the implementation performant
