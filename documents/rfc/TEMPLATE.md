# RFC-XXX

### Synopsis
Give a general overview about the covered content, aka. the â€œexecutive summaryâ€œ

### Background
Add details: Briefly outline the problem domain, illustrate previews implementations, the status quo and/or whatâ€™s wrong.

For documentation of discovery ticketâ€™s findings, briefly illustrate what the task was.

Link related tickets if applicable.

### [ Implementation/ Analysis / Findings / Proposal* ]
*Pick the ones that fits best*

For discovery ticket, describe what was explored and what was discovered. Draw conclusions and document the possible next steps.

When documenting a workflow, include graphs / charts that visualise the textual description.

When suggesting a new design, revisit the RFC when the decision for a specific design approach has been made.

### Out of scope

List anything that is explicitly outside of the scope of the RFC to help keep discussion focused and avoid scope creep.
Consider giving reasons for why something was considered out of scope. For example:
* X is/will be discussed in it's own RFC
* X is owned by another team who will define it themselves
* X is not required for an MVP

### Appendix
Optional link relevant information  (e.g API docs)

### Decision
For each person involved, list their review status [pending/approved/rejected]. Require explicit status reviews from each person.
