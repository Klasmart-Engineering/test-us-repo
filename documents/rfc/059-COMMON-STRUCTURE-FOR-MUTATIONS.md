# RFC-059

## Synopsis

In the context of reworking mutations, creating a structure (abstract class or interface) for all new mutations to follow help standardise our approach and speed up development. The structure should accomplish the following objectives:

1. Cut down on common code: there should be minimal code repetition across mutations

2. Impose a common approach for all mutations of the same type (Create/Update/Delete/Add/Remove)

## Background

This is a follow-up from [RFC-038-HOW-TO-STRUCTURE-MUTATIONS](https://bitbucket.org/calmisland/kidsloop-user-service/src/master/documents/rfc/038-How-to-structure-mutations.md), related to issue [AD-1724](https://calmisland.atlassian.net/browse/AD-1724). While RFC-038 specifies what to implement (details specified in the sub-RFCs located [here](https://bitbucket.org/calmisland/kidsloop-user-service/src/master/documents/rfc/mutations/)), it gives no instructions on how. This led to a divergence in our approaches within the team, which ended up slowing dow the development process.

We noticed that the mutations we wrote shared a basic structure:

1. Input Checks

2. Authorisation

3. Input Normalisation (for *Create* and *Update* mutations)

4. Validate database objects, make change & build output

5. Save to database

6. Return a structure to the caller

**Input checks**: this can include static checks (using JOI validations), and checks on the input length

**Authorisation**: check if the user calling the mutation has the appropriate permissions against a list of organisations and/or schools

**Input Normalisation**: make sure inputs are in a valid & consistent format (we have `clean` methods for this already), should also include all possible checks

**Validate Database Objects**: check that what was fetched from the database is what was expected

**Make Change**: modify the database objects, effectively performing the main objective of the mutation

**Build Output**: pass in the modified object to a list and format it for output. This will involve mapping an `EntityConnectionNode` to a `CoreEntityConnectionNode` if the `EntityConnectionNode` includes properties that are to be handled by resolvers (and thus don't need to be returned)

**Save to Database**: send an update query to the database for each input element. In the case of *Delete* mutations a batch update can be issued for all inputs (since all we're making the same change on all objects)

## Proposal

### Common structure

The new structure to follow can be found in `src/utils/mutations/commonStructure.ts` (TODO: replace this by link once merged to master). The abstract classes that mutations will have to use have the following signatures:

``` typescript
abstract class Mutation<E, I, O> {}
abstract class CreateMutation<E, I, O> extends Mutation<E, I, O> {}
abstract class UpdateMutation<E, I, O> extends Mutation<E, I, O> {}
abstract class AddRemoveMutation<E, I, O> extends Mutation<E, I, O> {}
abstract class DeleteMutation<E extends CustomBaseEntity, I, O> extends Mutation<E, I, O> {}
```

### How to use it as a resolver

The `DeleteCategories` mutation has been used as an example of how these classes should be used, the resolver function has been replaced by a class.

Before:

``` typescript
async function deleteCategories(
    args: { input: DeleteCategoryInput[] },
    context: Pick<Context, 'permissions'>
): Promise<CategoriesMutationResult> {}
```

Now:

``` typescript
class DeleteCategories extends DeleteMutation<Category, DeleteCategoryInput, CategoriesMutationResult> {}
```

### How to call the resolver

The mutation itself will be called by the `mutate()` method which is implemented in `Mutation`. All 6 steps are represented in this method:

``` typescript
async mutate(): Promise<O> {
    const input = this.i
    this.validateInputLength()
    const normalisedInput = await this.normalise(input)
    await this.authorise()
    const loopResults = await this.inputLoop(normalisedInput)
    await this.saveWrapper(loopResults.processedEntities)
    return loopResults.mutationOutput
}
```

The method would be called in the schema in the following way (still using `DeleteCategories` as an example):

``` typescript
export default function getDefault(
    model: Model,
    context?: Context
): GraphQLSchemaModule {
    return {
        typeDefs,
        resolvers: {
            Mutation: {
                deleteCategories: (_parent, args, ctx, _info) =>
                    new DeleteCategories(args.input, ctx).mutate(),
            },
        },
    }
}
```

### Testing

One of the most important aspects of this change is how it will affect testing. In the same way that the way we currently write mutations results in a lot of duplicate code, it also results in duplicate tests. There will be integration tests for the common structure in `tests/integration/commonStructure.tests.ts`, whatever is tested in there should not be tested again for each mutation.
